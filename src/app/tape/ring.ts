 * The trade dust's memory: every market order the source sent since the page opened (or since the ring last wrapped), held in one
 * fixed-size typed array laid out as the graphics card reads it, so a batch is copied in once and handed to the card as the same bytes.
 * Nothing is ever written to storage: a reload starts empty, and when the ring is full the oldest orders go.
 *
 * A record is `STRIDE` floats: time (ms after `t0`), price (after `p0`), signed USD (a buy positive), the market's index (`ids`), and the
 * lowest and highest price the order reached (after `p0`). Times and prices are kept relative to a base because a float32 holds about seven
 * digits: an epoch millisecond or a BTC price to the cent would lose what the drawing needs. The time base moves forward (`rebase`) before
 * the offsets grow past what a float32 holds to the millisecond.
 *
 * `segments` are the stretches the dust covers without a known gap, by exchange time: one begins at the first batch, after a reconnect and
 * after a batch the source says it skipped (its `seq` jumped) or trimmed (`dropped`), so a hole in the dust is never read as a quiet market.
