/**
 * Everything between the tracker's findings and the pixels: the changes of the last data frames waiting for a draw, the board that decides who
 * gets light, where each venue's cell was drawn, and the repainting of the lit cells over the resting material.
 *
 * The pane draws the material and the ink as it always did and then calls `end()`. If anything is lit, or a change is waiting, the material
 * canvas is copied once (the resting book, `#base`) and the cues are laid over it; from then on a frame is made by restoring the cells the
 * last frame lit from that copy and laying the cues again, so a frame costs the lit cells and nothing else (study 2026-10-22: 0.3 ms for 50
 * cells against the 1.4 to 6.7 ms of drawing the book again). When nothing is lit nothing is scheduled: an idle book draws no frame.
 *
 * A pane that is hidden, covered, in replay or switched off keeps nothing lit and takes no backlog of changes: what happened while it was
 * away is not played back (the tracker goes on observing, so its history stays whole).
