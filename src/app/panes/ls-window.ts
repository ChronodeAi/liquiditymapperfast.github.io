 * every venue has answered or after `LS_ROUND_MS`, whichever comes first). Otherwise the window asked is a view wider on each side than the view
 * needs, so zooming and panning a little ask nothing. A live view's end moving on is the minute refresh's to follow, not a new question. Asking
 * anew on every view change had a zoom send three requests a step, each up to a second and a half on the server, with the pane blank until the
 * last (2026-10-15).
