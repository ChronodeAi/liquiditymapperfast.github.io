/**

 * side was new; this gives each change of open interest to the side that traded at market on the same market over the same stretch (its
 * taker delta, or, where its flow is not recorded, the way the chart's price went). Up with buyers: longs opened; up with sellers: shorts
 * opened; down with sellers: longs closed; down with buyers: shorts closed.
 *
 * A market's change is measured between its own readings (its bars), never between values carried from one: a venue read every five minutes
 * (or hourly, in older history) changes once, by the whole step, in the candle of its new reading, and that step is given to its takers over
 * the whole stretch since the reading before, and marked coarse when that stretch is longer than a candle. Markets are each classified first
 * and then added up, so in one candle a venue's new longs and another's new shorts both show, and new longs beside shorts closed are +2 for
 * the longs side even when the open interest did not change.
