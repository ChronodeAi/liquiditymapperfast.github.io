 * The magnet: where a drawing's point goes when it is placed or dragged near something worth landing on (pure, tests/draw-magnet.test.mts).
 *
 * Its targets are the open, high, low and close of the candle under the pointer only (never a search across candles, so a chart zoomed out
 * cannot pull a point onto a neighbour), and, where the map has them, the walls of resting liquidity in the heat map's column under the
 * pointer: the rows that hold far more than their column does around them (Karl, 2026-10-28: "making use of the real liquidity walls").
 * Weak catches within a few pixels of a target, Strong from further, and both let go only past one and a half times that, so a point held
 * near two targets does not flicker between them. A committed point never moves when the candle under it does: it is a time and a price.
