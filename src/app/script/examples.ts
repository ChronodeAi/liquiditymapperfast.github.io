// end, the high (up) or the low (down). From that:
//   Breakout       a candle stayed inside the one before, and the next broke out of it: a quiet range gave way.
//   Failed break   a candle broke out of the one before, and the next took back the far end of that breakout candle:
//                  whoever followed the break is now on the wrong side of it.
//   Rejection      a candle went past the end before and closed back inside, with a long wick: the prices beyond were
//                  refused (the hammer and shooting star shapes).
//   Engulfing      a candle went past both ends and closed past one of them.
// Each pattern has a break level (the price it went through) and, where there is one, a next level: the far side of
// the range it is moving into. Point at a mark to read them, whether the next level was reached in that candle, what
// was bought and sold at market, the liquidations, the change in open interest, and where the hour's, day's, week's
// and month's opens stood. These describe what candles did. No test has shown that they say where price goes next.
